## Cognitive system: Brain (linked via `brain` CLI)
This project is linked to the Brain cognitive system. Do not read the node
repos directly — use the CLI.

**How to invoke it (try in order, use the first that runs):**
1. `brain <cmd>`
2. if `brain` is not found: `python "$HOME/.brain/Brain/bin/brain" <cmd>`
   (Windows PowerShell: `python "$env:USERPROFILE\.brain\Brain\bin\brain" <cmd>`)

When the user asks anything like "query save" / "ask brain X" / "mine this",
run the matching `brain` command yourself — do not make the user type paths.
Before non-trivial work: `brain query <terms>`. To capture lessons, write a
proposal file + `brain sync` (or `brain mine` for a work-list). `brain sync`
reconciles with main. Keep session output minimal.

### Using Brain well (read this before deciding it's empty)
- **Query with 1-2 KEYWORDS, not sentences.** `brain query reachability`, not
  `brain query "ai cannot reach the exit on a walled map"`. The matcher is
  keyword-based; long phrases return 0. **A 0-result query almost always means
  rephrase, not "empty system"** — try broader / single terms first, and read
  the `local:` bucket, not just the shared counts.
- **Re-query at each NEW sub-problem, not only at session start.** Every
  non-trivial bug or decision is its own retrieval trigger.
- **Capture non-bugs too, not only bugs:** reusable pattern -> `ideas`;
  unresolved fork -> `tension`; experiment/synthesis -> `exploration`; a
  committed decision -> an ADR in the build (and if it generalizes, ALSO an
  `ideas` kernel). See `orchestration.md`'s write-back table.
- **At each milestone, produce a Cognitive Update UNPROMPTED** (New Ideas,
  Memory, Tensions, Exploration, Graduation Candidates) — the standing rule in
  `orchestration.md`.
- **Surface any open (red/yellow) tension that touches your work to the user**
  before committing to that fork.
- **Never hand-write a proposal format.** `brain mine` prints the current
  schema verbatim from the memory repo — follow it exactly. A format you
  invent parses as an EMPTY entry and is held on every field at once.
